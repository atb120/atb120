Imagine calling someone on the phone, going hello! then putting them on hold... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

If you feel it's a bit brusque to simply say "Hi" and ask the question, you can still preface your message with as many pleasantries as you see fit.
For example:  
"hey man, what's up? also, any idea when that thing's due?"  
"Hi there! Hope you're well. I'm after the latest deck, when you get a sec :)"  
"hey, if you're not busy, could you update those NFRs?"  
etc.
